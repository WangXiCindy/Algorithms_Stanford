# About the homework

- This is the homework of Stanford Alogrithms on Coursera. This is a very good lesson and deeply talk about the algorithms. I really recognize you to study this. If you are a student, you can apply for a Financial Aid.
- This is just a sample result and please do not plagiarize.
- If you have a wrong answer, I really recommand you to go to the [Andrew's Exercise Solutions](http://andrew-exercise.blogspot.com/ ) and [Abhijit Sarkar's blog](https://blogs.asarkar.com/algorithms-design-analysis/set-2/) to find out the reason why the answer is wrong.
- Because of my ability limitation, the programming assignments may not be the best answer, If you have a better one, welcome to communicate with me.



# 这里是中文版块

- 这里是斯坦福大学算法课的个人参考答案。非常推荐大家学这门课，本来是因为作为自学课外课程学习的，结果发现比学校的算法课讲的深的多。如果你也是个学生党的话，可以申请助学金。
- 这里只是个参考答案，请不要抄袭
- 如果你做错了题且确实想不明白，推荐你去阅读 [Andrew's Exercise Solutions](http://andrew-exercise.blogspot.com/ ) 和  [Abhijit Sarkar's blog](https://blogs.asarkar.com/algorithms-design-analysis/set-2/) 的博客，写的很好。
- 因为个人能力以及时间缘故，代码题并非最佳答案，几乎全用暴力解决，所以一定有更好的方案，欢迎来和我一起学习交流。
